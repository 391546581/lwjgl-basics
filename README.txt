## About

*lwjgl-basics* is a minimal shader-based library for 2D sprite games. It provides essential utilities for textures, shaders, and sprite rendering.

For a large game project, a platform like [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) may be more suitable.

The [source code](https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics) is hosted on GitHub.
